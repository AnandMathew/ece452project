**Version 1**:

This is a story of Jerry the goose. When Jerry was a little gosling, he would always follow his mom around and act just like her. She taught him how to poop in inconvenient places and intimidate people on the sidewalk with heavy goose eye contact. One day, Jerry was out on a walk when a group of humans threw a bag over his mom and took her away. To this day, Jerry runs away from any people he sees.  

**Version 2** (less sad):  

This is a story of Jerry the goose. 
When Jerry was a little gosling, he would always play around with his red ball.
He would kick it around for hours on end, and it brought him endless joy.
One day, Jerry was out on a walk when a group of humans decided to kick his ball up to the sky.
To this day, Jerry climbs whatever he can to reach the sky and find his ball.
